<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I’m Praj🤍, a computer science student who is passionate about learning coding 
and building useful, effective projects that can make a real impact. 

I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my problem-solving skills, 
and continuously growing as a developer. I like challenging myself with new ideas 
and turning concepts into practical applications, especially projects that help me learn by doing. 

Apart from academics, football is a big part of my life — I love playing the game 
and it keeps me motivated and active. I also admire CR7 a lot because of his dedication, 
discipline, and strong mindset, which inspires me to stay focused on my own goals. 

Overall, I’m someone who believes in consistent improvement, creativity, 
and working hard to become better every day, both in technology and in life.
